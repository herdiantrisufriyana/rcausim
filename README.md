# rcausim: An R package to generate causally-simulated data

`rcausim` is an R package designed to generate causally-simulated data to serve as ground truth for evaluating methods in causal discovery and effect estimation. This is particularly useful for researchers in fields such as artificial intelligence, statistics, biology, medicine, epidemiology, economics, and social sciences, who are developing a general or a domain-specific methods to discover causal structures and estimate causal effects.


## Features

- **Define Functions and Edges**: Set up functions based on specified edges and conversely, set up edges based on functions.

- **Data Simulation**: Generate data according to predefined functions and network structures, adhering to principles of structural causal modeling.


## Installation

You can install the development version of `rcausim` from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("herdiantrisufriyana/rcausim")
```


## Quick Start

### Define Functions and Edges

#### Defining Causal Structure

Start by defining the causal structure as a data frame of edges:

```r
library(rcausim)
```

```r
# Load predefined edge data
data(edges)
print(edges)
```

Assist in setting up functions based on these edges:

```r
# Generate function setups from edge definitions
functions <- function_from_edge(edges)
print(functions)
```

Define specific functions:

```r
# Define a function for vertex B
function_B <- function(n){ rnorm(n, mean = 90, sd = 5) }
functions <- define(functions, 'B', function_B)
print(functions)
```

#### Alternatively, Start by Defining Functions

You can also start by defining functions directly:

```r
# Define a function for vertex B
function_B <- function(n){ rnorm(n, mean = 90, sd = 5) }

# Define a function for vertex A
function_A <- function(B){ ifelse(B>=95, 1, 0) }

# Combine functions in a list
functions <- list(A = function_A, B = function_B)
functions <- function_from_user(functions)
```

Ensure the causal structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG):

```r
library(igraph)
```

```r
# Set up edges based on functions
edges <- edge_from_function(functions)

# Check if the resulting edges form a DAG
g <- graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = TRUE)
is_dag(g)
```

### Data Simulation

Generate simulated data based on the predefined functions:

```r
# Assume completed functions setup
data(functions)

# Generate simulated data
set.seed(1)
simulated_data <- data_from_function(functions, n = 100)
print(simulated_data)
```
